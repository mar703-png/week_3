# # Week3
# # This week we will work on :
# # Working With Strings

# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users

# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game

# # # Review
# # create variables for the following :
# # 1. age
# age = 25
# # 2. name
# name = "John"
# # 3. song
# song = "Happy Birthday"
# # 4. food
# food = "Apples"
# # 5. number
# number = 1000

# # #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
# # Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
# #concatenation
# print ("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " old coder named " + name + ".")
# #f string
# print (f"Once upon a time, there was a {age} old coder named {name}.")

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# 1st_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percent
# variable_name
# O
# list_of_names
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart


# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_Name
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# one_variable
# email_address
# percentage
# i

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# # #addition
# print(2 + 2)
# # #multiplication
# print(2 * 2)
# # #division
# print(2 / 2)
# # #modulo
# print(2 % 2) #remainder
# # #powers
# print(2 ** 2)
# # #get the max and min of a number
# print(max(2, 3)) #max number of the two
# print(min(2, 3)) #min number of the two
# # #round a number
# print(round(2.5)) #rounds to the nearest whole number
# # # absolute value
# print(abs(-2)) #absolute value of the number
# # # order of operations
# print(2 + 10 * 10 + 3) #PEMDAS
# # #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
# from math import *    
# # #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use

# # #floor method
# print(floor(3.7)) #floor method
# print(floor(3.3)) #floor method
# print(floor(3.9)) #floor method
# #floor means it will always round down 

# # #ceil method
# print(ceil(3.7)) #ceil method
# print(ceil(3.3)) #ceil method

# # #sqrt method
# print(sqrt(36)) #square root method
# #sqrt method means it will find the
# square root of the number
#which is the number that when
# multiplied by itself gives the number

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
# name = input("What is your name?")
# print("Hello,", name)
# # # basic math calculator
# # #ask the user for 2 numbers
# number1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# number2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
# # # print out a statement where you:
# # # add them together
# print(number1 + number2)
# # #multiply
# print(number1 * number2)
# # # find the max number
# print(max(number1, number2))
# # # find the remainder of the numbers
# print(number1 % number2)
# # #round one number
# print(round(number1, number2))
